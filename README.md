# Ubuntu-Touch-Management-Console
Connect your Ubuntu Touch device to your computer and manage it with UT Management Console.

- File transfer
- Export photo album
- Terminal operations
- Anbox (Android-in-a-box) related operations
- Libertine Container Management
- Bootloader (Fastboot mode) related operations
- More features will be added in the future
- There may be some bugs at present, please understand. I'm still a rookie LOL! Thanks for your support and suggestions (if you have)!!!

Note: Whether Anbox related operations can be done depends on whether the Android emulator on your Ubuntu Touch device is working properly. If the operations fail, in most cases you might need to check if the Anbox on your UT device really works properly or not.

This programme is only for Windows! I'll rewrite the terminal pipe operation to add support for Mac soon!

通常，中文版更新进度较超前。请华人 UT 机友们尽量复制中文版的源码！
Sometimes, the update progress of Chinese version is more ahead of schedule. Sorry for the inconvenience!
