# Ubuntu-Touch-Management-Console
Connect your Ubuntu Touch device to your computer and manage it with UT Management Console.

- File transfer
- Export photo album
- Terminal operations
- Anbox (Android-in-a-box) related operations
- Bootloader (Fastboot mode) related operations
- More features will be added in the future
- There may be some bugs at present, please understand

Note: Whether Anbox related operations can be done depends on whether the Android emulator on your Ubuntu Touch device is working properly. If the operations fail, in most cases you might need to check if the Anbox on your UT device really works properly or not.

This programme is only for Windows!
